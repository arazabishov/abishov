If you have experience writing UI tests for android, you probably heard of tools like Spoon or Composer. Along with orchestration of test execution, they provide APIs for capturing screenshots which later are placed into generated HTML report. All of these is great, but there are certain associated shortcomings:

- Screenshot capturing logic clutters tests
- Hard to replace one library by another

Here is the example of an instrumentation test for a simple form screen:

```java
@RunWith(AndroidJUnit4.class)
public class FormScreenTest {

  @Rule
  public ActivityTestRule<FormActivity> activityTestRule =
          new ActivityTestRule<>(FormActivity.class);

  @Test
  public void clickOnSubmitMustHighlightErrors() {
    Spoon.screenshot(testRule.getActivity(), "state_before_edit");

    onView(withId(R.id.title)).perform(replaceText("test_title"));
    onView(withId(R.id.description)).perform(replaceText("test_description"));
    onView(withId(R.id.submit)).perform(click());

    Spoon.screenshot(testRule.getActivity(), "state_after_edit");
  }
}
```

Here I am using `Spoon` to capture screenshots which represent the state before and after user actions. This looks fine, but screenshot capturing logic shouldn't really be a part of the test body. Moreover, it simply becomes tedious to enter tags by hand, when they can be automatically derived from the test name. This is what we can have instead:

```java
@RunWith(AndroidJUnit4.class)
public class FormScreenTest {

  @Rule
  public ScreenshotsRule<FormActivity> screenshotsRule =
          new ScreenshotsRule<>(FormActivity.class);

  @Test
  @CaptureScreenshots
  public void clickOnSubmitMustHighlightErrors() {
    onView(withId(R.id.title)).perform(replaceText("test_title"));
    onView(withId(R.id.description)).perform(replaceText("test_description"));
    onView(withId(R.id.submit)).perform(click());
  }
}
```

Looks better huh? Here is another example where tags are specified explicitly and the state of activity is captured within test using the `screenshot("tag")` method:

```java
@RunWith(AndroidJUnit4.class)
public class FormScreenTest {

  @Rule
  public ScreenshotsRule<FormActivity> screenshotsRule =
          new ScreenshotsRule<>(FormActivity.class);

  @Test
  @CaptureScreenshots(before = "before_state", after = "after_state")
  public void clickOnSubmitMustHighlightErrors() {
    onView(withId(R.id.title)).perform(replaceText("test_title"));
    onView(withId(R.id.description)).perform(replaceText("test_description"));

    // capture screenshot within test
    screenshotsRule.screenshot("intermediate_state");

    onView(withId(R.id.submit)).perform(click());
  }
}
```

## Implementing ScreenshotsRule

So how do we get there? By writing a jUnit rule which knows where to grab an instance of `Activity` and when to invoke `Spoon`. First of all, let's create an annotation for marking tests which we want to "screenshot":

```java
@Target(METHOD)
@Retention(RUNTIME)
public @interface CaptureScreenshots {
  String before() default "";
  String after() default "";
}
```

Since we have to follow `ActivityTestRule`'s lifecycle, we will have to build our rule upon it:

```java
public class ScreenshotsRule<T extends Activity> extends ActivityTestRule<T> {
  private Description description;

  public ScreenshotsRule(Class<T> clazz) {
    super(clazz);
  }

  @Override
  public Statement apply(Statement base, Description description) {
    this.description = description;
    return super.apply(base, description);
  }

  @Override
  public void finishActivity() {
    if (getActivity() != null) {
      beforeActivityFinished();
    }
    super.finishActivity();
  }

  public void screenshot(String tag) {
    if (getActivity() == null) {
      throw new IllegalStateException("Activity has not been started yet" +
              " or has already been killed!");
    }

    Spoon.screenshot(getActivity(), tag, description.getClassName(),
            description.getMethodName());
  }

  Override
  protected void afterActivityLaunched() {
    CaptureScreenshots captureScreenshots =
            description.getAnnotation(CaptureScreenshots.class);
    if (captureScreenshots != null) {
      String tag = captureScreenshots.before();
      if (TextUtils.isEmpty(tag)) {
        tag = "before_" + description.getMethodName();
      }
      screenshot(tag);
    }
  }

  protected void beforeActivityFinished() {
    CaptureScreenshots captureScreenshots =
            description.getAnnotation(CaptureScreenshots.class);
    if (captureScreenshots != null) {
      String tag = captureScreenshots.after();
      if (TextUtils.isEmpty(tag)) {
        tag = "after_" + description.getMethodName();
      }
      screenshot(tag);
    }
  }
}
```

> I had to create a synthetic `beforeActivityFinished()` callback by overriding `finishActivity()` method, which is not the "cleanest" solution. See the [feature request](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/68897841) for adding it to `ActivityTestRule` in support library.

For the sake of simplicity and brevity of example, I have not overridden all of the parent constructors, but it is something what you most likely end-up doing in real world scenarios.

Within the `apply` method we are storing a reference to a `Description` object that contains useful metadata about the test. When a `@CaptureScreenshots` annotation is present, we have to take screenshots _after_ activity has been launched and _before_ it will be finished. When tags have not been supplied to the annotation, the name of the test method will be used as a basis for generating them.

Now we can substitute this rule for `ActivityTestRule` and we are good to go.

## Wrapping up

We have less boilerplate to write in tests! Moreover, dependency on Spoon or any other plugin you might be using is abstracted away. It means switching to another solution in the future will be less painful.
